The internet is a wire buried in the ground.

It might be fiber optics, copper, or occasionally beamed to satellites or through cell phone networks, but the internet is simply a wire. The internet is useful because two computers connected directly to this wire can communicate. A server is a special computer connected directly to the internet and contains web pages or files on that server's hard drive.

Every server has a unique Internet Protocol address or IP address, just like a postal address. IP addresses help computers find each other. We also give them names like google.com, Facebook.com.

So this is how it works. Your computer at home is not a server because it's not connected directly to the internet. Computers you and I use every day are called clients because they're connected indirectly to the internet through an internet service provider.



Whenever an email, picture, or web page travels across the internet, computers break the information into smaller pieces called "packets." When information reaches its destination, the packets are reassembled in their original order to make a picture, email, web page, or tweet.

Everything connected directly or indirectly to the internet has an IP address. Everything. That includes your computer, servers, cell phones, and all the equipment in between. Anywhere two or more parts of the internet intersect, there's a piece of equipment called a "router." Routers direct your packets around the internet, helping each packet get one step closer to its destination.

Every time you visit a website, upwards of 10 to 15 routers may help your packets find their way to and from your computer.

Imagine each packet as a piece of candy wrapped in several layers. The first layer is your computer's IP address: your computer sends the packet to the first router, which adds its own IP address. Each time the packet reaches a new router, another layer is added until it reaches the server. Then when the server sends back information, it creates packets with an identical wrapping. As the packet makes its way over the internet back to your computer, each router unwraps a layer to discover where to send the packet next until it reaches your computer.
